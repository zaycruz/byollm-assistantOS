# byollm-assistantOS Design System (v2.0)

## Design Philosophy: "Research Console"
The interface represents a high-performance instrument for intelligence augmentation. It eschews decorative elements for pure function, clarity, and precision. It feels "engineered" rather than "designed".

### Key Principles
1.  **Engineered Precision:** Every element aligns to a strict grid. Lines are thin (0.5pt - 1pt). Corners are sharp or minimally rounded.
2.  **Information Density:** High clarity, allowing for dense information without clutter. Whitespace is used structurally.
3.  **Quiet Confidence:** Dark matte backgrounds, low contrast for secondary elements, high contrast for primary data. No neon glow unless critical.
4.  **Glass & Steel:** Use of "smart glass" (blur materials) and "matte steel" (dark grays) metaphors.

## 1. Color Palette

### Base (Dark Matte)
The foundation of the UI. Avoids pure black for better eye comfort and depth.
-   `Background`: #050505 (Deepest matte)
-   `Surface`: #0F0F0F (Standard panels)
-   `SurfaceHighlight`: #1A1A1A (Hover/Active states)
-   `Border`: #333333 (Structural dividers)

### Accents (Selectable)
Single accent color used sparingly for active states, focus, and primary actions.
-   `Azure`: #007AFF (System Blue, but engineered) -> #2E9AFE
-   `Plasma Violet`: #7D5FFF
-   `Glacier Teal`: #00C7BE

### Functional
-   `TextPrimary`: #FFFFFF (100% opacity)
-   `TextSecondary`: #FFFFFF (60% opacity)
-   `TextTertiary`: #FFFFFF (40% opacity)
-   `Error`: #FF453A (Desaturated Red)
-   `Success`: #32D74B (Desaturated Green)
-   `Warning`: #FFD60A (Desaturated Yellow)

## 2. Typography Stack

Geometric, legible, monospaced-influenced.

-   **Primary Font:** System Design `Monospaced` or `Rounded` (User selectable, defaulting to Monospaced for the "console" feel).
-   **Scale:**
    -   `Display`: 32pt, Light/Thin
    -   `Header`: 20pt, Medium
    -   `Body`: 15pt, Regular
    -   `Caption`: 12pt, Regular
    -   `Code`: 13pt, Monospaced

---

## 3. Layout & Grid

-   **Spacing:** Base unit of 4pt. Common spacers: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32.
-   **Structure:**
    -   Sidebar: Fixed width (260pt), glass material.
    -   Main Content: Fluid, centered max-width for readability (800pt).
    -   Panel Borders: 1px separation lines.

---

## 4. Iconography

Abstract, primitive, stroke-based (SF Symbols).
-   **Style:** Light or Regular weight.
-   **Usage:** Strictly functional. No decorative icons.
-   **Animation:** Discrete state changes (e.g., filled vs. outline).

---

## 5. Motion Principles

"Quiet and Mechanical".
-   **Duration:** 150ms - 200ms.
-   **Curve:** Ease-out (fast start, precise stop).
-   **Transitions:** Slide and Fade. No bouncy springs.
-   **Feedback:** Instant visual response to touch (micro-illumination of borders).

---

## 6. Components

### Smart Panels
-   Background: `UltraThinMaterial` or Dark Matte with 80% opacity.
-   Border: 0.5pt solid color (white/accent @ 20%).
-   Corner Radius: 4pt or 8pt (Tight).

### Input Field ("Command Line")
-   Appearance: Minimal strip at bottom.
-   Focus: Accent color border glow (1px).
-   Placeholder: "Enter command..." or "Query..."

### Message Blocks
-   **User:** Right aligned, simple text, Accent Color subtle indicator.
-   **System:** Left aligned, full width or block, distinct "terminal" styling for code/thinking.
-   **Thinking:** Collapsible section, monospaced font, dimmed color.

---

## 7. Accessibility

-   **Contrast:** Ensure 4.5:1 ratio for all text.
-   **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44x44pt despite visual density.
-   **Type:** Support Dynamic Type scaling.
-   **Motion:** Respect "Reduce Motion" settings (fade instead of slide).

---

## 8. Rationale

This design serves the user's intent to "Bring Your Own LLM" by treating the LLM as a tool/instrument. The "Research Console" aesthetic reduces cognitive load, allowing the user to focus on the text and data generated by the model. It feels professional, private, and powerful.
